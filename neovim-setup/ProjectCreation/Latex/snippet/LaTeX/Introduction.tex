\section{Introduction}

The total set of publicly traded companies in the world is insurmountable; the 
New York Stock Exchange trades about $2400$ companies alone as of 2021~\cite{WikiNYSE}.
It would take a single investor a lifetime to coumbe through the financial statements,
the historical data, and the news about every company.
